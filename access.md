## Focus Indicators / Keyboard Navigation

Example 1, default focus indicator is a slight change of font colour (placed here on Reports) but you may need to look closely.

Example 2, with focus indicator as a yellow highlight.

Example 3, introducing a context sensitive 'skip' shortcut to the New Ticket button. Pops into view if user begins using <tab> for keyboard only navigation and want to skip straight to the new ticket button.
